## 1. Tell Me About Yourself
I'm currently pursuing my BTech in [Your Branch] from [Your College]. I have a strong interest in technology and software development. I've recently been learning SAP ABAP and also exploring stock trading in my free time. I enjoy taking on new challenges and believe in continuous learning. I'm looking forward to applying my skills and growing with a company like HCL.

## 2. Tell Me About Your Project Step-by-Step

During my training, I built an Employee Master application using the RAP (RESTful Application Programming) model.

1. **Database Table**: Created ZTB_RAP_EMP_887 with employee details (ID, Name, Address, Department).
2. **CDS Views**:
   - Root View Entity
   - Projection View with UI annotations like `@UI.lineItem`, `@UI.selectionField`
3. **Behavior Definition**:
   - Enabled Create, Update, Delete with managed implementation
4. **Service Definition and Binding**:
   - Exposed CDS views via OData V4
   - Integrated with Fiori Elements (List Report/Object Page)
5. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry via Eclipse ADT

This gave me end-to-end RAP hands-on experience including backend logic and frontend exposure.

## 11. Data Element vs Domain

| Concept       | Role                                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Domain        | Technical attributes (type, length)        |
| Data Element  | Semantic meaning (field label, doc)        |

---

## 12. Master Data vs Transactional Data

- **Master Data**: Static, reused (e.g., Employee)
- **Transactional Data**: Dynamic, day-to-day (e.g., Sales)

---

## 13. SELECT Query Syntax

```abap
SELECT * FROM zemployee INTO TABLE @DATA(it_emp).
LOOP AT it_emp INTO DATA(wa_emp).
  WRITE: / wa_emp-emp_id, wa_emp-name.
ENDLOOP.
```

---

## 14. Internal Table vs Work Area

```abap
DATA: it_emp TYPE TABLE OF zemployee,
      wa_emp TYPE zemployee.
```

---

## 15. ABAP Program to Print Hello World

```abap
REPORT z_hello_world.
WRITE: 'Hello World'.
```

---
