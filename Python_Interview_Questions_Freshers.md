A reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

## ‚úÖ 10. How do you define a function in Python?
```python

    # code block
````

## ‚úÖ 11. What is the difference between \*args and \*\*kwargs?

* `*args`: variable number of positional arguments
* `**kwargs`: variable number of keyword arguments

## ‚úÖ 12. What is indentation in Python?

Indentation defines the block of code and is mandatory in Python (usually 4 spaces).

## ‚úÖ 13. What are Python modules?

Files containing Python code (.py) that can be imported and reused.

## ‚úÖ 14. What is a package in Python?

A collection of Python modules organized in directories with an `__init__.py` file.

## ‚úÖ 15. What is the use of the `pass` statement?

A null statement used as a placeholder where code will be written later.

## ‚úÖ 16. What is the difference between `break` and `continue`?

* `break`: exits the loop
* `continue`: skips current iteration

## ‚úÖ 17. How does the `range()` function work?

Generates a sequence of numbers, used in loops.
Example: `range(0, 5)` generates 0 to 4.

## ‚úÖ 18. What is the purpose of `self` parameter?

Refers to the current instance of the class; used to access instance attributes.

## ‚úÖ 19. Difference between deep copy and shallow copy?

* Shallow copy: copies object reference
* Deep copy: creates new object and copies all data

## ‚úÖ 20. How do you handle exceptions in Python?

```python
try:
    # code
except Exception as e:
    # handle exception
```

## ‚úÖ 21. What is the purpose of the `finally` block?

It runs regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.

## ‚úÖ 22. What is a lambda function?

An anonymous function written as:

```python
lambda args: expression
```

## ‚úÖ 23. What is list comprehension?

A concise way to create lists:

```python
[x for x in range(5)]
```

## ‚úÖ 24. What is a generator?

A function that yields values one at a time using `yield`.

## ‚úÖ 25. How to open a file in Python?

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

## ‚úÖ 26. What are Python decorators?

Functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods.

## ‚úÖ 27. What is recursion in Python?

A function calling itself to solve smaller problems.

## ‚úÖ 28. What are \*args and \*\*kwargs?

* `*args`: collects extra positional arguments
* `**kwargs`: collects extra keyword arguments

## ‚úÖ 29. What is the use of `__init__` method?

Used to initialize object attributes during class instantiation.

## ‚úÖ 30. What is a class and object in Python?

* Class: blueprint for creating objects
* Object: instance of a class

## ‚úÖ 31. What is inheritance?

Allows a class to inherit methods and attributes from another class.

## ‚úÖ 32. What is multiple inheritance?

A class inheriting from more than one base class.

## ‚úÖ 33. Difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod`?

* `@staticmethod`: no self or cls
* `@classmethod`: takes `cls` as the first argument

## ‚úÖ 34. What is the `__str__()` method?

Defines the string representation of an object.

## ‚úÖ 35. What are built-in data structures in Python?

List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary

## ‚úÖ 36. What is slicing in Python?

Extracting a part of a sequence:

```python
s[1:5:2]
```

## ‚úÖ 37. What is a lambda function?

A short anonymous function:

```python
lambda x: x * 2
```

## ‚úÖ 38. Difference between mutable and immutable objects?

* Mutable: can change (list, dict)
* Immutable: can‚Äôt change (tuple, str, int)

## ‚úÖ 39. How do you convert string to int in Python?

```python
int("123")
```

## ‚úÖ 40. What is the purpose of `isinstance()`?

Checks if an object is an instance of a class.

## ‚úÖ 41. Difference between `append()` and `extend()`?

* `append()`: adds one element
* `extend()`: adds elements from an iterable

## ‚úÖ 42. What is a docstring?

A string literal used to document code.

## ‚úÖ 43. What is pickling in Python?

Serializing an object using the `pickle` module.

## ‚úÖ 44. What is the use of `dir()` function?

Returns list of attributes and methods of an object.

## ‚úÖ 45. Difference between `input()` and `raw_input()`?

* Python 3: only `input()` exists
* Python 2: `raw_input()` used to read string input

## ‚úÖ 46. How do you install packages in Python?

```bash
pip install package_name
```

## ‚úÖ 47. What is a virtual environment?

An isolated environment for managing dependencies per project.

## ‚úÖ 48. What is `if __name__ == "__main__"` used for?

Ensures code runs only when script is executed directly.

## ‚úÖ 49. What is the use of `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`?

* `map()`: applies function to each item
* `filter()`: filters items based on condition
* `reduce()`: reduces a list to a single value

## ‚úÖ 50. What is a Python iterator?

An object with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.

## ‚úÖ 51. What is a Python generator?

A function that yields values one by one using `yield`.
